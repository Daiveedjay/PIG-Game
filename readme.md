Here's how the game works

1. Firstly, it's a 2 player game at best
2. Player 1 and player 2 get turns to roll the dice
3. After each roll, each player can choose to roll again or hold already accumulated points
4. If a player chooses to hold his/her points, active mode transfers to the next player
5. If a player rolls a 1, all his accumulated points for that turn is lost and play is transferred to the next player, hence the need to keep rolling with caution ðŸ˜‚
6. First player to accumulated 100 points wins the game. Have fun.
